# My React Project

## Description

This is a React application designed to demonstrate component interaction, state management, and rendering interfaces using React.

## Features

- **Components**: Breaks the UI into independent, reusable parts.
- **State Management**: Uses React Hooks to manage component state.
- **Routing**: Implements `react-router` for navigating between different pages.
- **API Integration**: Fetches and displays data from external APIs.
